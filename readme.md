# Acknowledgements

A lot of our design decisions and architecture are inspired by [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob).

We learned lot from [sps](https://github.com/alexykn/sps/). While we share similar goals, our visions differ: we don't want to reinvent package management from scratch. Our focus is on delivering an exceptional user experience while leveraging Homebrew's proven ecosystem.

We also owe huge thanks to the Homebrew community, maintainers, and contributors. They have built an incredible ecosystem that makes fastbrew possible in the first place. We're not trying to replace Homebrew. fastbrew is simply our way of giving back, experimenting, and hopefully helping the broader ecosystem continue to thrive.
