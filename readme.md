Homebrew, but faster, safer and nicer!

# Acknowledgements

A lot of our design decisions and architecture are inspired by [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob).

We learned lot from [sps](https://github.com/alexykn/sps/). While we share similar goals, our visions differ: we don't want to reinvent package management from scratch. Our focus is on delivering an exceptional user experience while leveraging Homebrew's proven ecosystem.
